# Open Data Ensemble (ODE)

**A comprehensive platform for designing, capturing, and synchronizing field data with precision and reliability.**

ODE is a modular, open-source toolset engineered for development practitioners, researchers, and humanitarian teams. Built with clarity and control in mind, ODE enables organizations to compose powerful data collection workflows that excel in challenging field environments.

---

## Overview

ODE provides a complete solution for mobile-first data collection, designed to operate seamlessly in offline environments while maintaining robust synchronization capabilities. The platform emphasizes interoperability, extensibility, and a clean developer experience.

---

## Core Components

### [Formulus](https://github.com/OpenDataEnsemble/ode/tree/dev/formulus)

A mobile-first form engine built on [JSONForms](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms), optimized for field usability and offline operation. Formulus delivers an intuitive interface for data collection across Android and iOS devices, designed specifically for real-world field constraints and challenging environments.

### [Synkronus](https://github.com/OpenDataEnsemble/ode/tree/dev/synkronus)

The synchronization layer and backend API, engineered for offline resilience and seamless data flow. Synkronus handles data synchronization, storage, and provides the backbone for all data operations across the platform. It's built for reliability in environments where connectivity may be intermittent.

### [Synkronus CLI](https://github.com/OpenDataEnsemble/ode/tree/dev/synkronus-cli)

Command-line utilities and development tools to help you develop, test, and manage your data collection workflows. Includes utilities for custom app data management, user administration, and data export capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Open Source & Community-Driven**: Built with transparency and community collaboration at its core. The entire platform is FLOSS, giving you full control over your data collection infrastructure.

- **Field-Optimized**: Designed specifically for real-world field constraints and challenging environments. ODE excels in situations where connectivity is unreliable or completely absent.

- **Interoperable & Extensible**: Built on open standards with a modular architecture for easy extension. The platform is designed to integrate with your existing tools and workflows.

- **Developer-Focused**: Clean APIs and comprehensive tooling for a superior development experience. Spend your time designing data collection instruments instead of building infrastructure.

- **Offline-First**: Robust offline capabilities with reliable synchronization when connectivity is restored. Your data collection continues regardless of network conditions.

- **Cross-Platform**: Available for both Android and iOS devices, ensuring broad accessibility across different hardware and operating systems.
