# ODE â€“ Open Data Ensemble

ðŸŽ¼ **A symphony of open data instrumentsâ€”ready for fieldwork, made for impact.**

ODE is a modular, open-source toolset for designing, capturing, and synchronizing field data with clarity and control. Built for development practitioners, researchers, and humanitarian teams, ODE helps you compose powerful data collection workflows with ease.

### ðŸŽ» Instruments in the Ensemble

- **Formulus** â€“ The mobile-first form engine, built on [JSONForms](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms) and optimized for field usability.
- **Synkronus** â€“ The synchronization layer and backend API, built for offline resilience and seamless data flow.
- **CLI + Dev Tools** â€“ Utilities to help you develop, test, and manage your data instruments.

### ðŸš€ Why ODE?

- Open and community-driven
- Designed for real-world field constraints
- Built for interoperability and extensibility
- Clean, focused developer experience
